# Apogee_Detection_Database

Detecting the apogee of a ballistic body, such as a projectile or a ballistic missile, can be more challenging compared to orbiting objects. Since ballistic bodies follow a free-flight trajectory without propulsion or sustained orbital motion, their apogee is determined by their initial launch conditions and the effects of gravity and air resistance.

Based on changing altitude, there are different mathematical means to detect the apogee of a ballistic body. Here are a few commonly used methods:

1. Maximum Altitude Method: This method involves recording altitude measurements at regular intervals during the flight. The apogee is then determined by identifying the highest recorded altitude. This method is straightforward and relies on selecting the maximum value from the collected altitude data.

2. Curve Fitting: Altitude measurements can be fitted to a mathematical curve or trajectory model that describes the flight path of the ballistic body. By fitting the data points to the curve, it is possible to determine the point where the curve reaches its maximum, corresponding to the apogee.

3. Derivative Analysis: The derivative of altitude with respect to time can provide insights into the changes in altitude over time. The apogee corresponds to the point where the derivative changes from positive to negative (i.e., the maximum of the first derivative). By analyzing the derivative of altitude, the apogee can be estimated.

4. Peak Detection Algorithm: This algorithm detects peaks in a time series data, in this case, the altitude measurements. The algorithm identifies the local maxima in the data, representing the highest points reached during the flight. By applying a peak detection algorithm to the altitude measurements, the apogee can be determined.

5. Numerical Optimization: This method involves using optimization techniques to find the maximum altitude point. Various optimization algorithms, such as gradient-based or evolutionary algorithms, can be employed to search for the maximum altitude point in the collected altitude data.

It's important to note that these methods provide estimations of the apogee based on the available altitude measurements. The accuracy of the apogee determination depends on the quality and frequency of altitude data, as well as the chosen mathematical method. Additionally, environmental factors, sensor limitations, and noise in the measurements can affect the accuracy of these methods.
